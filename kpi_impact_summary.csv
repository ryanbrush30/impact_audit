What KPI's made impacts to the data,,,,,,,"Why the numbers are the same across p10, p50, and p90",,
CFG = Config(,,,,,,,"You may notice that p10, p50, and p90 are identical for each KPI.",,
    kpi_steps={,,,,,,,This is expected and not an error.,,
"        ""avg_vacancy_days"": -5.0,",,,,,,,,,
"        ""productivity_index"": +0.05,",,,,,,,Why this happens:,,
"        ""operating_margin_pct"": +0.01,",,,,,,,"The KPI impact analysis applies a fixed, controlled change to each KPI (for example, reducing vacancy days by X or increasing productivity by Y).",,
"        ""quality_incidents"": -1.0,",,,,,,,That same change is applied uniformly across all business units.,,
"        ""headcount"": +2.0,",,,,,,,"Because the model response to that change is linear and stable, the resulting revenue impact does not vary across units.",,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,In plain terms:,,
,,,,,,,"This is a scenario result, not a distribution of uncertain outcomes.",,
,,,,,,,,,
,,,,,,,How to Use This in Decision-Making,,
,,,,,,,"These results rank levers by expected revenue impact, not certainty.",,
,,,,,,,They are best used to answer:,,
,,,,,,,“Where should leadership focus first for revenue impact?”,,
,,,,,,,“Which operational improvements matter most financially?”,,
,,,,,,,"The outputs are not causal guarantees, but directionally strong, data-supported signals.",,
