The Impact Audit modeling pipeline completed successfully, producing validated attrition risk predictions, business unit revenue forecasts, and KPI impact outputs using strictly time-separated test data. The results demonstrate strong predictive performance in a highly imbalanced workforce context and provide actionable signal for prioritization, planning, and scenario analysis.

The attrition risk model was evaluated on a forward three-month horizon beginning May 1, 2025, with a base attrition rate of approximately 2 percent. Despite this low event rate, the model achieved excellent ranking performance, with a test ROC-AUC of 0.941 and a precision-recall AUC of 0.244, representing a substantial improvement over random selection at this base rate. Most importantly from a decision standpoint, the model delivers a lift of 9.17x in the top 10 percent of flagged risk, meaning employees identified as highest risk are over nine times more likely to experience attrition than the average employee.

When applying a top-10 percent risk threshold, the model captures approximately 92 percent of all attrition events while limiting focus to a small, manageable segment of the workforce. This confirms that the model is well suited for targeted retention strategies, early intervention, and proactive workforce planning rather than broad, unfocused action. Classification metrics further reinforce that the model prioritizes recall among attrition events, which is appropriate given the business cost asymmetry between missed attrition and false positives.

In parallel, the business unit–level revenue forecasting model was trained and evaluated using a clean time split starting April 1, 2025. The model achieved an R² of 0.511 and a mean absolute error of approximately $325K, indicating that workforce and KPI signals explain a meaningful portion of near-term revenue variation. This level of performance is appropriate for scenario modeling and directional decision support rather than point-estimate forecasting.
