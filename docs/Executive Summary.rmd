# Executive Summary  
## Understanding How Performance Practices Shape Long-Term Business Results

Organizations make thousands of performance-related decisions every year: who to promote, who to reward, who to develop, and who to retain.

These decisions are usually evaluated in isolation, focused on fairness, process compliance, or short-term outcomes.

What is rarely examined is their **long-term business impact**.

This analysis addresses that gap.

---
## What This Analysis Does

Impact Audit reconstructs multiple years of workforce history and examines:

1. Historical performance and compensation decisions  
2. How those decisions shaped workforce composition and stability  
3. How the resulting workforce influenced KPIs  
4. How KPIs ultimately affected future revenue  

Rather than snapshots, the model follows **cause-and-effect over time**.

## What the Model Reveals

Performance practices are not administrative actions. They are **long-term shaping mechanisms**.

They influence:

- Who stays and who leaves  
- How experience accumulates  
- Where capacity constraints emerge  
- How resilient and scalable the organization becomes  

Some decisions create short-term gains with long-term tradeoffs. Others create delayed but sustained performance advantages.

The model makes those timing effects visible.

## Why This Matters

This reframes performance management as a strategic governance question:

Are our historical people decisions producing the business results we want today, and the organization we need tomorrow?

By linking workforce decisions directly to business outcomes, leaders can evaluate:

- Whether past practices supported sustainable growth  
- Where current approaches create hidden risk  
- Which workforce levers drive meaningful business impact  

---
## How Leaders Should Use This

This is not a tool for blame or hindsight judgment.

It is a **forward-looking decision framework** designed to:

- Improve performance practice design  
- Anticipate workforce-driven business risk  
- Align people strategy with long-term business objectives  

In short, Impact Audit provides leaders with an evidence-based view of how yesterday’s decisions are shaping today’s results and tomorrow’s readiness.
